# Roll the dice
# Example Solution: Roll the Dice
#
# The game "Roll the dice" is a dice game for two players. Both Players roll a dice six times.
# The first throw should be a one, the second a two and the third a three and so on.
# If the number of points of the dice is equal to the number of throws, add the respective
# points to the account of the particular player. The winner is the player who has the most
# points at the end of the game.
